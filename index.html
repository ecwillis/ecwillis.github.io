          <p>As you will see below, I am a senior level developer who has been building and architecting web apps for startups for close to 10 years now. I have worked with every major scripting language, as well as every major web framework there is.</p>
          <p>My approach to web development is a bit unique however. Having started my career in construction, I take a more holistic approach to developing a project, keeping the larger project goals and objectives in mind. Being able to see the whole picture is what sets me apart from many other developers.</p>

          <p class="ew-all">SnapWire is a photo marketplace based in Santa Barbara, CA who is working on matching photo buyers from the agency world to the up and coming photographers that work within instagram and the mobile photography space. Their app utilizes a native iOS app, and a web app (with JSON API) where photographers can upload their best photo work to sell.</p>
          <p class="ew-lead"><span class="label label-default">leadership</span> I was originally brought in as a consultant to assist the CEO and the co-founder in building a development strategy that would help them move their development cycles forward. Prior to my arrival, the team had been using a waterfall method to assign tasks to various developers. As the business and sales needs progressed however, so did the priorities of the app features. Sometimes multiple times per week. This was leaving the developers frustrated and ineffective as they never had time to finish a task before it was shifted again.</p>
          <p class="ew-lead">Our strategy was to transition the team to an agile development methodology with set sprints, and a clearly defined backlog. This would allow the CEO and future product teams the opportunity to develop the priorities of the business independently of what was being developed for any given sprint. We also re-defined their massive backlog into themes and epics to more clearly outline a product roadmap that could be developed over time.</p>
          <p class="ew-tech"><span class="label label-default">developer</span> During the agile conversion process I also assisted the development team with both backend and front end development wherever was needed. The largest portion of the project that I undertook was the addition of a shopping cart system into their app where there previously was a single item purchase system called WePay that was causing customer friction. The resulting cart integrated with their complex sales infrastructure allowing buyers to purchase multiple photos at once, while allowing sellers to collect their earnings in an escrow account and take them out at will.</p>
          <p class="ew-dev-ops"><span class="label label-default">dev-ops</span> As the senior developer on the team at the time, I took over an maintained the devops infrastructure for the app as well. As the user base grew, it became necessary to implement a horizontal scaling paradigm to handle the additional server load. Using the built in AWS tools, we segregated the server responsibilities, and added additional web server nodes underneath the built in AWS load balancer to begin answering traffic in an efficient manner. I developed the Chef recipe's (Opscode) that handled the server deployments, and initiated the auto-acaling mechanism using custom python scripts to build web server nodes as required.</p>
