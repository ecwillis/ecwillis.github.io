          <p class="lead">Welcome to my GitHub page. I will keep this page updated as a personal reference to projects I have either built or worked on, along with links where appropriate.</p>
          <p>As you will see below, I am a senior level developer who has been building and architecting web apps for startups for close to 10 years now. I have worked with every major scripting language, as well as every major web framework there is.</p>
          <p>My approach to web development is a bit unique however. Having started my career in construction, I take a more holistic approach to developing a project, keeping the larger project goals and objectives in mind. Being able to see the whole picture is what sets me apart from many other developers.</p>
